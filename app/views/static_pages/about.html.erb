<h1><big><dt>About Us</dt></big></h1>
<h2>We're a team of American college students who came to Africa to learn Ruby on Rails and learn about social issues in South Africa.</h2>
 <h2>We realized that one of the major issues South Africa faces is its history.</h2>
 <h2> History is convoluted, and too many know little or nothing about it.</h2>
 <h2> And so began TriviaFundi, an endeavor to teach history to the citizens of South Africa.</h2>

<h1><em>That men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of history. --Aldous Huxley</em></h1>
